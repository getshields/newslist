"No attack damage was reduced, but much of the added damage for this Super went into the heavy attack Striker Terminal Velocity There are now three tiers of hang time The amount of hang time for each tier has been reworked Each tier of hang time now causes four damaging shocks instead of three The damage for the hang time bonuses has been increased significantly Trample The light shoulder attack Super cost has been reduced by 85% Trample can now trigger every 0.5 seconds, up from every 1 second Warlock Dawnblade Voidwalker Cataclysm Increased detonation radius Cluster damage increased Improved cluster bomb homing to make it more consistent against single targets Cluster bombs no longer detonate one another Vortex Linger damage increased significantly Nova Warp Slower movement while charging Charging costs more energy and overall duration is reduced Damage resistance reduced very slightly PvP damage reduction Charged detonation will no longer be able to one shot another player in their Super, provided it has damage resistance Notes : The Nova Warp changes above are all small, but we think together they will help bring it down into a good placea place similar to the Supers that weâ€™re raising up."
